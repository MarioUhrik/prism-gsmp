/**
 * This is a library for finding roots of polynomials created by Adrian Elgyutt in 2017
 * as the objective of his Master's thesis (see {@link https://is.muni.cz/th/396222/fi_m/}).
 * It was inserted into PRISM by Mario Uhrik in 2018. 
 * <br>
 * As for now, there are some Slovak comments in the code.
 * Mostly, the relevant files have been copy-pasted as they were,
 * with only slight modifications for cleaner integration.
